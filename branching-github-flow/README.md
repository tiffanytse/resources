# Git Branching & GitHub Flow

Think about how you generally work on some code. You write some code then decide you want to try something else, so you make a copy, maybe you name it `version-2`. Then you decide you want to try something else, you copy and name it `version-3`.

Now you have a litter of different files for different features you’ve tried out.

**Git branching solves this problem by providing a clean way to make copies of your code to work on a specific feature.**

## GitHub Flow

There’s a process called GitHub Flow that’s very popular for working on teams.

The idea is that your `master` branch should never be coded on directly. Instead you should create a new branch for each feature you’re adding.

When you are satisfied with your changes you sync to GitHub, make a pull request, get feedback and merge.

### 1. Make a new branch in the GitHub app

### 4. Sync the branch to GitHub

### 5. Press the compare & review button
